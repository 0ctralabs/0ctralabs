# Octra Labs

Welcome to the official repository of **Octra Labs**, the team behind **Octra Network** – a scalable, decentralized platform built for fully homomorphic encrypted (FHE) computation and storage.

## 🚀 What is Octra?

**Octra** is a next-generation decentralized P2P network that enables secure data processing and storage using FHE, empowering developers to build privacy-preserving, scalable applications.

- 🔐 **FHE-by-default**: Process encrypted data without decrypting it.
- 🧠 **Parallel HFHE Computing**: Scalable encrypted logic on hypergraphs.
- 🧱 **Modular Architecture**: Build dApps, blockchains, AI agents, and more.
- 📦 **Circles**: Encrypted isolated environments for compute, storage, or apps.
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Over 800 TPS in testnet with scalable throughput.
- 🗄️ **Native Decentralized Storage**: Verifiably encrypted, torrent-style storage.
- 🤝 **Interop Support**: Use Octra as L1, co-processor, or encrypted state layer.

## 🌐 Use Cases

Octra enables secure applications across sectors:

- Private stablecoin payments
- Confidential DeFi and smart contracts
- Encrypted decentralized AI training
- Secure rollups and confidential compute layers
- Real-world asset tokenization
- Barter/dark pool markets and privacy-preserving CEX alternatives
- Identity and compliance with full user control

## 🧩 Core Components

- **Octra Protocol** – P2P actor-based message routing layer
